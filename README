Example user id's: test (password: test), bro (password: jones)

Our design assumes that database security is not important. User information, 
username and password, are not encrypted in the database. There are also
some assumptions made when inputing data, for example all dates must be in the format
yyyy-MM-dd. All input requirements are shown to the
user in the prompt.
